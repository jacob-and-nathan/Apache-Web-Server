                <p class="mainTitle">Tip #1: Underpaintings.</p>
                <p class="mainText">Underpaintings, are a (usually watery) wash of a small amount of colours that are done before the main painting.
                <br /><br />
                They are good because they provide a good basework for the rest of the painting.
                <br /><br />
                To do one, paint the WHOLE canvas with a colour (for example Burnt Umber).<br />
                Once you have completed it, you can start your main painting!
                <br /><br />
                Acrylic is a good medium to do this with, as it dries extremely fast.</p>

            <div id="main3">
                <p class="mainTitle">Tip #2: Experiment with different mediums.</p>
                <p class="mainText">Painting mediums are fluids, that can be mixed with the paint, to give a specific effect.
                <br /><br />     
                The effect could be drying faster or slower, or changing the consistency.</p>

                <p class="mainTitle">Tip #3: Invest in some good quality art supplies.</p>
                <p class="mainText">It can make a substancial difference if you buy some better quality art supplies.
                <br />
                If you don’t know what to invest in first, here is my advice:<br />
                <br />
                START with whatever is the most important. For example paper, or a pallete.<br />
                THEN, get some better quality brushes.<br />
                THEN, get some better paints.<br />
                AFTER that, get anything else that you want.<br />
                <br />
                You don’t HAVE to follow this, but that is a suggestion.</p>
